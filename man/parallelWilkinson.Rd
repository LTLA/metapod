\title{Combine p-values with Wilkinson's method}
\usage{
parallelWilkinson(p.values, log.p = FALSE, min.n = 1, min.prop = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{p.values}{A list of numeric vectors of the same length, containing the p-values to be combined.}

\item{log.p}{Logical scalar indicating whether the p-values in \code{p.values} are log-transformed.}

\item{min.n}{Integer scalar specifying the minimum number of individual nulls to reject when testing the joint null.}

\item{min.prop}{Numeric scalar in [0, 1], specifying the minimum proportion of individual nulls to reject when testing the joint null.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{p.value}, a numeric vector of length equal to the length of each vector in \code{p.values}.
This contains the combined p-value for each group, log-transformed if \code{log.p=TRUE}.
\item \code{representative}, an integer scalar specifying the representative test in each group.
\item \code{influential}, a list of logical vectors mirroring the structure of \code{p.values}.
Entries are \code{TRUE} for any p-value that is deemed \dQuote{influential} to the final per-group p-value.
}
}
\description{
Combine p-values from parallel tests with Wilkinson's method.
Each group of p-values is defined from the corresponding entries across all vectors.
The function processes all vectors \dQuote{in parallel} - hence the name.
}
\details{
Here, the joint null hypothesis for each group is all individual null hypotheses are false.
Rejection of the joint null is heavily favored in situations where \eqn{N} or more individual nulls are rejected.
This is achieved in Wilkinson's method by considering the \eqn{N}-th order statistic for uniformly distributed p-values.
The individual tests are assumed to be independent, and all weights are ignored.

\eqn{N} is defined as the larger of \code{min.n} and the product of \code{min.prop} with the number of tests in the group (rounded up).
This allows users to scale rejection of the joint null with the size of the group, while avoiding a too-low \eqn{N} when the group is small.
Note that \eqn{N} is always capped at the total size of the group.

The representative test for each group is defined as that with the \eqn{N}-th smallest p-value, as this is used to compute the combined p-value.
The influential tests for each group are defined as those with p-values no greater than the representative test's p-value.
This is based on the fact that increasing them (e.g., by setting them to unity) would result in a larger combined p-value.

\examples{
p1 <- rbeta(100, 0.8, 1)
p2 <- runif(100)
p3 <- rbeta(100, 0.5, 1)

# Standard application:
out <- parallelWilkinson(list(p1, p2, p3))
str(out)

# With log p-values. 
out <- parallelWilkinson(list(log(p1), log(p2), log(p3)), log.p=TRUE)
str(out)
