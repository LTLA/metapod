\title{Combine grouped p-values with Pearson's method}
\usage{
groupedPearson(p.values, grouping, log.p = FALSE, is.rle = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p.values}{A numeric vector containing p-values for individual tests.}

\item{grouping}{A vector or factor of length equal to \code{p.values}, specifying the group to which each test is assigned.

Alternatively, if \code{is.rle=TRUE}, an \link{rle} object specifying consecutive entries of \code{effects} that are in the same group.}

\item{log.p}{Logical scalar indicating whether the p-values in \code{p.values} are log-transformed.}

\item{is.rle}{Logical scalar indicating whether \code{grouping} is an \link{rle} object.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{p.value}, a named numeric vector of length equal to the number of unique levels in \code{grouping}.
This contains the Pearson combined p-value for each group, log-transformed if \code{log.p=TRUE}.
Each entry is named according to the group.
\item \code{representative}, a named integer scalar specifying the representative test for each group.
Each entry is named according to the group.
\item \code{influential}, a logical vector of length equal to \code{p.values}.
Entries are \code{TRUE} for any p-value that is deemed \dQuote{influential} to the final combined p-value for its group.
}
}
\description{
Combine p-values from grouped tests with Pearson's method.
Groups are defined according to unique levels of a grouping factor.
}
\details{
Here, the joint null hypothesis for each group is that all of the individual null hypotheses are true.
Pearson's method combines information from all individual nulls to determine if the joint null should be rejected.
Compared to Stouffer's and Pearson's methods, Pearson's method is more sensitive to the largest individual p-value.
This method is only applicable to independent tests and no weights are considered.

The representative test for each group is defined as the test with the largest p-value, as this has the greatest effect on the combined p-value. 
All tests for each group are considered to be influential as increasing any of them (e.g., to unity) would result in a larger combined p-value.

p1 <- rbeta(100, 0.8, 1)
g <- sample(10, length(p1), replace=TRUE)

# Standard application:
out <- groupedPearson(p1, g)
str(out)

# With log p-values. 
out <- groupedPearson(log(p1), g, log.p=TRUE)
str(out)
