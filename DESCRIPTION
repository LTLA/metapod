Description:
    Implements a variety of methods for combining p-values in differential
    analyses of genome-scale datasets. Functions can combine p-values across
    different tests in the same analysis (e.g., genomic windows in ChIP-seq,
    exons in RNA-seq) or for corresponding tests across separate analyses
    (e.g., replicated comparisons, effect of different treatment conditions).
    Functions are provided for parallel and grouped meta-analyses, with support
    for weighting where appropriate, log-transformed inputs and missing values.
