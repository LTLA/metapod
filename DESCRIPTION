Description:
    Implements a variety of methods for combining p-values in differential analyses 
    of genome-scale datasets. Functions can combine p-values across different tests
    in the same analysis (e.g., genomic windows in ChIP-seq, exons in RNA-seq) or 
    for corresponding tests across separate analyses (e.g., independent studies).
